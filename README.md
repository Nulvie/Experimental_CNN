# Experimental_CNN
A convolutional neural network architecture to take in multiple inputs. In this case, x and a potential additional variable "dotb". This is to test the performance of a CNN model with and without dotb. To account for additional model parameters and complexity, dotb's layers are replaced by x in its absence.
